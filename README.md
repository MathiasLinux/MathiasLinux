### Hello everyone, I’m Mathias.

Graduated in BUT MMI in Mulhouse, France.

I love different IT domains:

- 🐧 I love using Linux, it can be to deploy services, to create scripts in Bash to simplify my daily life, or even just for fun!

- 👨‍💻 I also love programming in various languages: PHP, JS, Python, Java and C. It can be for a website, for a desktop application or for a script. I'm always ready to discover new languages, frameworks or techniques.

- 🗃️ I love using databases as well. I like to imagine the best way to store datas, what strutures and systems to use, to get the best performance and usability.

- 🌐 Finally, I also love to create and manage networks. Create networks so they can be secure and fast.

🎓 I'm currently searching for a new training, to expand my knowledge in all theses domains.

I hope you will like my work!
